	<h2>CONGRESS INTRODUCTION
</h2>
					<p>Cyberspace, the seamless integration of physical, social, and mental spaces, is an integral part of our society, ranging from learning and entertainment to business and cultural activities, and so on. There are, however, in addition to its technical challenges, a number of pressing issues such as safety and trust associated with the cyberspace. For example, how do we strike a balance between the need for strong cybersecurity and preserving the privacy of ordinary citizens? 

To address these challenges, there is a need to establish new science and research portfolios that incorporate cyber-physical, cyber-social, cyber-intelligent, and cyber-life technologies in a cohesive and efficient manner. This is the aim of the IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech). IEEE CyberSciTech has been successfully held in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2016, in Orlando, USA, in 2017,  in Athens, Greece, in 2018, and in Fukuoka, Japan, in 2019. 

In 2020, we will continue to offer IEEE CyberSciTech with the aim of providing a common platform for scientists,
 researchers, and engineers to share their latest ideas and advances in the broad scope of cyber-related science, 
 technology, and application topics. In addition, this is also a platform to allow relevant stakeholders to get 
 together, discuss and identify ongoing and emerging challenges, in order to understand and shape new 
 cyber-enabled worlds.</p>
